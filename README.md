Cytoscape 3 App Developers: Legend-creator 
================================================
This is a repository of a new sample app that is more comprehensive than other samples. 

As a part of building the legend, it traverses the structure of the current network, serving as a good example of how to access the network model and view.

Then it uses that information to create annotations that are inserted onto the Cytoscape canvas.

This example shows how to add a tab to the the control panel, how to add a menu item that brings that tab to the foreground, and how to create annotations based on the state of the current network.
